# **Comparing Both Implementations (From Scratch vs. TensorFlow)**

#### 1. **Ease of Use**:
   - **From Scratch**: Requires implementing every function, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent. This helps you understand how neural networks work but is time-consuming.
   - **TensorFlow**: Provides high-level abstractions, allowing you to define and train a neural network with just a few lines of code. Much faster to set up.

#### 2. **Performance**:
   - **From Scratch**: The custom implementation might be slower, especially with large datasets, as it’s not optimized for efficiency.
   - **TensorFlow**: Highly optimized and can leverage GPU/TPU acceleration. TensorFlow's back-end computations are faster and more efficient, especially for large-scale problems.

#### 3. **Flexibility**:
   - **From Scratch**: You have full control over the internal workings of the network. You can tweak and experiment with every detail, which is great for learning.
   - **TensorFlow**: Offers flexibility for building complex models, but it abstracts many internal details. You can still fine-tune most aspects, but it’s more convenient to use for practical applications.

#### 4. **Use Case**:
   - **From Scratch**: Best suited for educational purposes, small-scale projects, or learning how neural networks work under the hood.
   - **TensorFlow**: Suitable for practical applications, industry use, and larger, more complex models due to its performance and ease of use.
